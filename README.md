How to compile
----------
### Build on Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils git cmake libboost-all-dev
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev

    # If you want to build the Qt GUI:
    sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

    git clone git://github.com/siriuscore/sirius
    cd sirius

    # Note autogen will prompt to install some more dependencies if needed
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure 
    make -j2

### Build on OSX

The commands in this guide should be executed in a Terminal application.
The built-in one is located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

#### Preparation

Install the OS X command line tools:

`xcode-select --install`

When the popup appears, click `Install`.

Then install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

#### Dependencies

    brew install cmake automake berkeley-db4 libtool boost --c++11 --without-single --without-static miniupnpc openssl pkg-config protobuf qt5 libevent imagemagick --with-librsvg

NOTE: Building with Qt4 is still supported, however, could result in a broken UI. Building with Qt5 is recommended.

#### Build Sirius Core

1. Clone the sirius source code and cd into `sirius`

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/siriuscore/sirius.git
        cd sirius

2.  Build sirius-core:

    Configure and build the headless sirius binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).

    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.

        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make

3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests:

        make check

### Run

Then you can either run the command-line daemon using `src/siriusd` and `src/sirius-cli`, or you can run the Qt GUI using `src/qt/sirius-qt`
